# fortiche

a UCI-commpliant chess engine, written in Fortran. I'm using the "Simply fortran" IDE for the development.

## random information below 

The project is still a mess. 

To compile on linux : make -f Makefile.linux all

I'm planning to use a phtread for fortran module for linux. See the paper in docs. Also see : "O. Awile and I. F. Sbalzarini. A pthreads wrapper for Fortran 2003. ACM Trans. Math. Softw., 40(3):19:1â€“19:15, 2014."
